This bundle contains PCB designs and firmware for a 6-tube Nixie clock
that has the ability to be clocked from 3 separate sources (32 kHz
crystal, TCXO RTC, GPS). 

Issues:

Version 1 of the circuit should have the CRST trace cut so that it
does not reach the GPS reset pin. I haven't tried the circuit without
the cut but different pull-up voltage may cause problems.

Version 1 of the circuit has an issue with the 32 kHz clock. It
appears to require a currently undetermined small capacitance in order
to oscillate at 32 kHz. This goes against what the Atmel AVR RTC
application note and the datasheet for the at90usb1287 seem to say.
